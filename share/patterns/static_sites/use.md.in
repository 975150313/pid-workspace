## Import the package

You can import @PACKAGE_NAME@ as usual with PID. In the root CMakelists.txt file of your package, after the package declaration you have to write something like:

{% highlight cmake %}
find_package (@PACKAGE_NAME@ REQUIRED)
declare_PID_Package_Dependency(PACKAGE @PACKAGE_NAME@ NATIVE)
{% endhighlight %}

It will try to install last version of the package.

If you want a specific version (recommended), for instance the currently last released version:

{% highlight cmake %}
# finding package with classic CMake command, use a version number
find_package (@PACKAGE_NAME@ @PACKAGE_LAST_VERSION_WITH_PATCH@ REQUIRED)
# register the package dependency before using it in components
declare_PID_Package_Dependency(PACKAGE @PACKAGE_NAME@ NATIVE VERSION @PACKAGE_LAST_VERSION_WITHOUT_PATCH@)
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that PID will automatically install the last available patch version of the package when configuring the project with the option `REQUIRED_PACKAGES_AUTOMATIC_DOWNLOAD` to **ON** (default value).
