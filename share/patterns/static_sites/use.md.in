# Usage

## Import the package

You can import @PROJECT_NAME@ as usual with PID. In the root CMakelists.txt file of your package, after the package declaration you have to write something like:

```
find_package (@PROJECT_NAME@ REQUIRED)
declare_PID_Package_Dependency(PACKAGE @PROJECT_NAME@ NATIVE)
```
It will try to install last version of the package.

If you want a specific version (recommended), for instance the currently last released version:

```
find_package (@PROJECT_NAME@ @PACKAGE_LAST_VERSION_WITH_PATCH@ REQUIRED)
declare_PID_Package_Dependency(PACKAGE @PROJECT_NAME@ NATIVE VERSION @PACKAGE_LAST_VERSION_WITHOUT_PATCH@)
```

Notice that PID will automatically install the last available patch version of the package when configuring the project with the option `REQUIRED_PACKAGES_AUTOMATIC_DOWNLOAD` to **ON** (default value).
